# Lost Private key

Zillet does not manage accounts with information such as passwords, private keys, or emails. In order to ensure your security and privacy, no sensitive data is ever saved, stored, or transmitted when you use Zillet. We only have access to the information that is publicly available on the blockchain. We do not have servers and we do not hold your assets.

Only users themselves can access and control their funds – this is the purpose of decentralized networks. Your funds are stored on the Ethereum blockchain itself, and we are simply an interface that allows you to easily interact with them. Passwords and private keys are in the users’ hands and are the users’ responsibility.

Unfortunately, this means we cannot:

* Recover your private key
* Access your account
* Recover or reset your password
* Reverse or cancel transactions
* Recover your account
* Send your cryptocurrency or tokens from one address to another

There may be a chance that you saved it without realizing it. We recommend the following:

* Do a full search of your computer for "UTC--" and see if the private key shows up. 
* Do a full search of your computer for your address *without* the 0x at the beginning.
* If you know *when* you created it, look through all files during that time period for any documents or screenshots.
* Generate a new wallet via [https://zillet.com/create](https://zillet.com/create) and take a look at the different options you may have downloaded or saved. Sometimes that can jog your memory.

In the future, we highly recommend you print out a paper version of your wallet and keep it in multiple physical locations. [You can read more about how to safely create and back up your wallet here.](/getting-started/how-to-create-a-wallet)
