# Lost Password


Zillet does not manage accounts with information such as passwords, private keys, or emails. In order to ensure your security and privacy, no sensitive data is ever saved, stored, or transmitted when you use Zillet. We only have access to the information that is publicly available on the blockchain. We do not have servers and we do not hold your assets.

Only users themselves can access and control their funds – this is the purpose of decentralized networks. Your funds are stored on the Ethereum blockchain itself, and we are simply an interface that allows you to easily interact with them. Passwords and private keys are in the users’ hands and are the users’ responsibility.

Unfortunately, this means we cannot:

* Recover or reset your password
* Recover your private key
* Reverse or cancel transactions
* Access your account
* Recover your account
* Send your cryptocurrency or tokens from one address to another

**However**, there are some services that can help you recover your private key.
 
* [Wallet Recovery Services](https://walletrecoveryservices.com/) - Can potentially recover your account if you have an idea of what your password may be. They have great reviews. Check out their site for more details on what they can and cannot recover.
* [Keychainx](https://keychainx.io/) - Another recovery service that can help you out if you have a slight idea of what your password may be.

In the future, we highly recommend you print out a paper version of your wallet and keep it in multiple physical locations. [You can read more about how to safely create and back up your wallet here.](/getting-started/how-to-create-a-wallet)
