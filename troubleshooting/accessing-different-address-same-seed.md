# Private Key Not Working

Be sure there is no space at the beginning or end of your private key. We validate based on the number of characters. If you saved another version (for example, the UTC / Keystore file) it may also be worth trying that file as well.

Please be sure that you are **carefully and accurately** typing your private key. A single wrong character will open a different wallet than "yours".
